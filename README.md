# File Moving Script

This is a Node.js script designed to move files from a source folder to different target folders based on file type.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.

2. Copy the code and modify the paths in `sourceFolder` and `targetFolders` to your own directories.

3. Run the script using `node your-script-file.js`.

That's all you need to know to use the script.
